        "Once upon a time, there was a fish called Tuna who lived happily in his pool.",
        "One day, an evil creature came and cursed Tuna with cancer.",
        "Despite the curse, Tuna was determined to survive and decided to take matters into his own fins.",
        "He started to swim as fast as he could and swim away from the cancer.",
        "Unfortunately, Tuna was not fast enough and the cancer started to catch up with him.",
        "He used his last bit of strength to push himself forward and one last time, he swam as fast as he could.",
        "To Tuna's surprise, he made it!",
        "He had just put enough distance between him and the cancer that he managed to escape its claws.",
        "From then on, Tuna found joy and happiness in life and swam carefree in his pool.",
        "He was thankful that he was able to stab run his way out of danger and never faced such danger ever again."
